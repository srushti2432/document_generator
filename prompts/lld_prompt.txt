2. Class diagrams and relationships (if applicable)
3. Function-level design with:
   - Function names
   - Input parameters
   - Return values
   - Internal logic explanation
4. Code citations:
   - Clearly mention file names, class names, and function names where logic is implemented
   - Quote brief code snippets if needed for clarity
5. Dependencies used (external libraries or APIs)
6. Data models or data structures used, including their fields and purposes
7. Explanation of control flow and key logic branches
8. Security considerations or edge case handling (if applicable)
